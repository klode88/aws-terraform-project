# aws-terraform-project
This project demonstrates a fully serverless architecture using Amazon API Gateway, AWS Step Functions, and Amazon DynamoDB ‚Äî all provisioned and connected using Terraform. It avoids using AWS Lambda entirely, which is typically the default compute option in serverless projects.
# üöÄ Serverless API Gateway to Step Functions to DynamoDB (No Lambda)

This project demonstrates a **serverless architecture** using:

- **Amazon API Gateway (REST API)**
- **AWS Step Functions**
- **Amazon DynamoDB**
- **Terraform** for infrastructure as code (IaC)

‚úÖ **No Lambda functions were used** ‚Äî we used **Step Functions directly** from API Gateway to orchestrate DynamoDB actions.

---

## üîç Project Overview

This serverless app exposes an HTTP POST endpoint (`/tasks`) via **API Gateway**, which triggers a **Step Function**, which in turn could write to **DynamoDB** or perform other tasks.

### üß† Why Step Functions Instead of Lambda?

- **No Runtime to Manage**: No code to deploy or maintain.
- **Cost-Effective**: No Lambda invocation costs; ideal for lightweight tasks.
- **Built-in Observability**: Visual workflow UI and native retries.
- **Simplified Security**: API Gateway assumes an IAM role to invoke Step Functions directly.
- **Infrastructure-Only Focus**: All behavior is defined in Terraform.

| ‚ùå `No valid credential sources found`                                      | Fixed by configuring AWS credentials using `aws configure`                                             |
| ‚ùå `BadRequestException: Operation AWS::DynamoDB::PutItem is not supported` | This happened because we mistakenly used a Lambda-style integration; we switched to Step Functions     |
| ‚ùå `Missing credentials_arn`                                                | Added an IAM role allowing API Gateway to invoke Step Functions                                        |
